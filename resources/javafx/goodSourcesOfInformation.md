## TODO

### Application logic in JavaFX
Bindings might be something I can use? I might be able to set a boolean value on show button and therefore be able to refresh the scene.

Bindings are used to bind the value in the model with the GUI representation. If value changes, so does the view. I should be able to bind a state in my model, say ifIsShow do x, and so on.

Detta verkar fungera, att man lägger in state i Model, switch case på det så är man hemma

javafx logic/state when eventhandling
